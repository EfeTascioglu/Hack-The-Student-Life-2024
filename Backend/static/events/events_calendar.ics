SUMMARY:Introduction to Open Educational Resources
DESCRIPTION:Are you curious about finding teaching materials to support 
 student learning? Or perhaps you are interested in developing teaching 
 materials that all students can access? Celebrate Open Education Week and 
 learn how Open Educational Resources (OER) can be optimized for 
 instructional use in this interactive workshop. OER reduces the financial 
 barrier to access materials for students while also strengthening student 
 engagement and learning. You will be introduced to what OER is in 
 comparison to other ‘free’ materials\, unpack the meaning of Creative 
 Commons licensing when using OER\, practice attributing open resources like 
 images\, find and assess OER that you can use in your teaching\, and last 
 discuss how you can contribute to the OER community. \n\nBy the end of the 
 session you will: \n\ndefine open educational resources (OER) \nidentify 
 the different types of Creative Commons licenses and what each allows/does 
 not allow for the use of an OER \ncorrectly attribute open resource such as 
 images that may be used in presentations \nlocate OER including open 
 textbooks\, lab/activity materials\, lesson plans\, lectures\, and more 
 \ndiscuss the challenges and benefits of using OER in your teaching  
 \nassess how you will use OER in your own teaching such as adopt\, adapt\, 
 create\, and contribute  \n\nFacilitator: David Kwasny - Data and Digital

SUMMARY:Introduction to Prompt Engineering for Information Literacy
DESCRIPTION:In this workshop participants will participate in discussions 
 and activities in order to more effectively prompt generative AI tools\, 
 such as Chat-GPT\, to acquire results that more accurately represent their 
 desired outcomes. This workshop is focused on the use of generative AI in a 
 flipped classroom approach. Participants will gain understanding of their 
 research topics through the use of AI\, and then utilizing library 
 resources to fact check the content and improve and refine their research 
 questions. \n\nObjectives: \nLearners will gain hands-on experience in 
 crafting effective prompts for interacting with Generative Artificial 
 Intelligence (GPT-3 or similar models)\nLearners will understand the 
 importance of prompt engineering in obtaining desired and meaningful 
 responses.\nLearners will validate the information they are provided by the 
 Generative Artificial Intelligence by using Library resources\nLearners 
 will assess their findings and share their result.\n\nFacilitator: David
